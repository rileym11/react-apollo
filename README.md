# React & Apollo Gitpod Sandbox

This is a gitpodified version of the sample project that belongs to the [React & Apollo Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) on How to GraphQL.

## How to use

### 1. Open the Repository with Gitpod

Navigate to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rileym11/react-apollo

### 2. Start the server

To start the server, all you need to do is execute the `start` script by running the following command inside the `server` directory:

```sh
yarn start
```

> **Note**: If you want to interact with the GraphQL API of the server inside a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground), you can navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).


### 3. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well. The command needs to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory `react-apollo` (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

```sh
yarn start
```
